## OUTPUT :

## Support Removal Process:
## Step 1:

This is the main part attached with the support structure which needs to be removed.
## Step 2:

Chemical solution for removal of support material is taken in a container.
## step 3:

The part with support is dipped and allowed to set inside the container.
## Step 4:

After this process we will get out final product without the support structure.
## Step 5&6:

This is the start and stop of the process for support removal which is nothing but allowing the product the set inside the container.


## UV Curing of 3D printed part
# Step 1:

This is our part before UV curing.

# Step 2:

These are the UV curing machines that heat the model to bring it to its ideal mechanical properties after being printed.

# Step 3:

Our part is placed inside the UV curing machine for curing process.

# Step 4:

This is our part after the process of UV curing.


# Step 5&6:

Curing differs from the other post-processing options as it enhanches also the physical quality of the model with properties.
## Heat Treatment of 3D printed part
# Step 1:

This is our part before Heat Treatement Process.

# Step 2:

![image](https://github.com/saniyaganesamoorthy/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/145742583/02c5d142-9b7c-4f64-bdd2-1999e04ac61d)

This is the Heat treatement oven. In which we will place our part.

# Step 3:

![Screenshot 2023-12-16 154621](https://github.com/saniyaganesamoorthy/Ex.No.9---SIMULATION-OF-POST--PROCESSING-IN-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING/assets/145742583/466f808a-3630-4294-9a55-1fb8559c0c14)

Our patr is placed inside the Heat Treatement Oven for Heat Treatement process.

# Step 4:

This is our product after the Heat treatment process.Heat Treatment removes the internal stresses developed in part during printing and changes the part's microstructure.


# Step 5&6:

Normally in modern use,the microstructure's change targets explicit properties like hardness,strength,sturdiness,and wear opposition.
